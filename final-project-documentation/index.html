                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>This work takes inspiration from the ancient Chinese legend "Zhuangzi's Butterfly Dream"[1]. The protagonist, a robot, dreams of becoming human and acquiring human senses, gradually becoming aware of human emotions during the journey, and getting lost in the dual identity. In the first scene, the protagonist is guided into the dream at the boundary between dream and reality. In the second scene, the protagonist meets the ancient Zhou Gong in a parallel time and space. In the third scene, the protagonist realizes his human identity during the process. In the fourth scene, the protagonist turns into a butterfly and flies back to the starting point of the dream. The scene implies the fictitious nature of the dream through the change of main colours and the simulation of the dream's construction through rise and fall and elements that appear repeatedly.</p>

                <h3>Concept and Background Research</h3>
                
                <p>When I first decided to create a VR work, I was drawn to the idea of designing an interactive narrative experience that differed from the traditional interactive gameplay experience. As someone who loves theatre and literature, I was inspired by The Under Presents: Tempest [2], an immersive VR theatrical experience that uses dialogue and guided design to engage players and propel the storyline. Unlike traditional VR games that prioritize gameplay over storytelling, the Under Presents VR experience uses interactivity to advance the plot. In this type of work, the story is the focus. Moreover, the immersive environment created by VR is advantageous in shaping the atmosphere to achieve a lifelike experience for the players. In comparison to movies and plays, which are also narrative genres, the form of theatre, unlike movies, cannot use editing and transition techniques, making it actually closer to the expression form of VR. </p>
                <p>In theatre, directors use actor placement and changes in scenery to signify transitions between locations. I used these same techniques to design my work. I placed multiple scenes in one Unity scene and used portals and scripts to switch between them. Props were used to bridge the gap between transitions to make them seem less abrupt. As a first-person narrative experience, my work required guiding players along a predetermined path. I implemented trigger points and added barriers to control the player's movements. </p>
                <p>The works of VR artist Christophe Bruchansky[3] also influenced my work. His models have a rough texture, but this did not detract from his artistic expression; rather, it highlighted his personal style. </p>
                <p>To create the dialogue for my work, I used prompts [4] to input descriptions of the scene and concepts and input the generated monologue to refine them.</p>

                <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>

                <p>Several scenes are divided into two stages, in the dream (red) and outside the dream (pink), using different skybox renderings. The most important and most difficult problem is that the scenes in the portal and outside the portal must be in the same scene, but they must have their own reflections. At the beginning, I only wrote the script to switch the skybox. Later I found that if I only switched the skybox, the reflections of the object would still show the color of the previously rendered color. I referred to a tutorial [5] and switched to custom in the skybox reflections source. After that, you need to save the “cubemap” rendered by the respective skybox and switch the “cubemap” at the same time when switching the skybox. But the second act will be displayed in the portal in the first act. If he only switches after entering, the red skybox will still be rendered in the portal before entering. Therefore, I added a Reflection Probe to each scene separately, and baked the reflections in the second, third and fourth scenes under the pink skybox, so that even if the skybox changes in the main scene, it will not affect the reflection colour of the object.  </p>
                <p>Portal [6] itself acts as a mask, and the internal display depends on whether the layer is rendered. The objects in the portal need to be put into the same layer. The "show" script is triggered when a player collides with each scene switch, and the objects that need to appear and disappear are dragged into the game objects list in the script. </p>

                <p>Interaction Design - Scene One
                    The interactive logic of this scene is as follows: when the elevator button is pressed, the elevator door opens. Once the player enters the elevator, the door closes and the elevator ascends. Upon reaching the designated floor, the door opens again.
                    The script is divided into two parts. Firstly, the “VRButton” script is attached to the elevator button trigger. Secondly, the “MyDoor” script is attached to the elevator platform. When the button is pressed, the “My_button” function in “MyDoor” is activated. Once the player collides with the trigger on the platform, the door closes and an animation is triggered. Initially, I attached the “MyDoor” script directly to the moving platform. I discovered that the box collider had to be set as “is trigger”. This setting resulted in the player falling off the platform while moving. The issue was eventually resolved by creating a new empty object and transferring the script onto it.
                    </p>
                <p>Interaction Design - Scene Two
                    The interactive logic of this scene is as follows: as the player approaches the ghost, it gradually dissolves and transforms into a holographic butterfly.
                    The dissolving material of the ghost was referenced from [7] tutorial. Furthermore, a trigger was set to change the material of the ghost to transparent. The holographic butterfly material was created using tutorial [8]. When designing the flight path of the butterfly, animating it frame by frame resulted in a stiff and unnatural effect. In addition, the flapping animation of the butterfly wings had to be synchronized with its movement animation. Eventually, I found the Path Creator plugin and used it to design the flight path. Additionally, the follower script was added to the butterfly to cause it to stop moving once it reaches the endpoint. The pavilion at the bottom of the lake also utilized the portal effect.
                    </p>
                <p>Interaction Design - Scene Three
                    As the player reaches the trigger point, roots start growing. Once the roots are touched, the digital tree becomes larger.
                    The root growth was referenced from tutorial [9]. It was imperative that the UV of the object be adjusted correctly to enable proper growth of the material. As the length of each branch was different, conditions had to be set in the script to limit growth to prevent the branches from growing too long or too short (e.g. -1 or +1). The flow materials in the electronic tree follow the tutorial [10], wherein a 'flowmap' needs to be drawn to illustrate the flow direction from the branches towards the trunk. The tree model is divided into three parts, and each part's UV needs to be exported separately in Blender. In the electronic tree, XR Simple Interactable is used to trigger the scaling, which then triggers the flight path to the fourth scene.

                <p>Scene Design - Scene Fourth
                    The mirrors in the environment provide a better visual angle to the scene. An animation of a lotus flower blooming was also created, and when flying past the lotus, it will bloom accordingly.

                <p>Since there are many balloons, assigning a tag to all of them would allow the bullets to hit all of the balloons. Initially, the script for the collision between the bullet and the balloon was placed on the bullet. I wanted the particle system to activate when the balloon was destroyed, but it was unable to activate. Later, I learned that it was because the particle generation location had not been specified.</p>

                <!-- default flex item is for 4 & follows media query styling for home page -->
                
                <p>Because bullet generation is cloned, this command cannot be placed on the bullet. Therefore, I rewrote the 'BalloonExplode' script on the balloon and set the tag for the bullet prefab. In this script, the position of the particle generation is specified, and I also want the balloon to be able to regenerate after disappearing. Therefore, I need to create a method for the balloon to transmit the activation command after collision, but delay it by five seconds to prevent the problem of not being able to activate again after the object is destroyed.</p>
                <p>All materials used in the project are sourced from Flat Kit. Additionally, animations of a Ferris wheel and swings were added to make the scene more lively.</p>

                <h3>Reflection and Future Development</h3>
                <p>The current scene content is not yet rich enough. As an amusement park, project amenities and things that make it fun should be added. For songs-inspired works, there should be more lyrical links and richer imagination for each facility. If it is a derivative of a song, lyrics or narrative interaction from a more obvious storyline work best.
                    Different directions, speeds, and swings would make the Ferris wheel and swing animations more realistic. There should be animation of balloons bursting during the explosion process. Diamond particles should embed in sand after falling. A radio that requires pressing down and playing while crouching is more realistic.</p>

                <p>The size ratio of the models in the environment also needs to be carefully considered. After importing from Blender to Unity, although I used real-world scale as a reference during the design process, after putting on the headset, my perception of objects is slightly different from what I saw in the modeling software. The overall size of the area is still smaller than I expected (although I hope to keep the project small in scale). This is also something to consider when making VR projects, especially for a purely fictional scene with few reference scales.</p>
                <p>Throughout the production process, I have learned a lot. Although VR projects are fictitious, their users are human, and some sense of scale is necessary to give users a more realistic experience. What is different is that imagination and interaction that cannot be achieved in the real world can be realized in the VR world. In animation design, if set in the real world, all gravity, friction, and different interactions brought about by different materials need to be considered. Only in practice can one know that even the loss of a small detail will affect the final result.</p>
